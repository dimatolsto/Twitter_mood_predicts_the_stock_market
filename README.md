Twitter_mood_predicts_the_stock_market
======================================

a project for the class Introduction to Data Science

Project problems:

1)  Filter live tweets for companies and keywords (bancrupcy, corporate events, news, etc.). There is not much to datamine there: just pull the trigger.

2) Follow the paper: http://www.relevantdata.com/pdfs/IUStudy.pdf I don't think we should reinvent the bicycle.
The problem is we need the historical tweets for the some period (the longer the better) to get time series from tweets. Is there any tweet database?
Otherwise we'll keep parced tweets in a database.

3)  Classify tweets as financial \ other, positive \ negative, bullish \ bearish. For a start, we could use the assignment 1 results or simple approaches from spam filtering here.

4) For a more advanced mining, I know a good metrics to claster \ classify tweets in a semantic space. 
It is based on Google search results. So we should learn Google API. I beleive it is no more difficult as the twitter one.

5) Using google trends in a right way http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130425/srep01684/full/srep01684.html

Any more ideas are thoughts are welcome.  Thanks.
